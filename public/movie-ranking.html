<h1>Alexander's Top 3</h1>
<h2>My 3 Favourite Films of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</h3>
<p>Edgar Wright's feature is a feast for the eyes. No detail was spared in this immaculate comedy.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>These films cannot be taken as individual pieces. They are a collective unit with incredible heart and music.</p>

<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<p>Between the soundtrack and the quick dialogue, there is little to criticise about this incredible drama.</p>
